	<p>I've spent my professional life in IT, busying myself with enterprise server and desktop systems. Looking for a change, I took a 9 month certification course to learn about Javascript, PHP, and database methodologies. Enamored by the power and potential of the web, I took the plunge, quit my job, and changed careers. This page is step 1... or 5, of that change. Something like that.</p>
