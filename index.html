	<p>I have been passionate about technology <a class='portfoliopics' style="color: white;" href="images/babydean.jpg" title='My first "laptop"'>for as long as I can remember</a>. Growing up around computers and during the advent of the internet I've experienced the power of technology first hand. In no case has this been more evident than the presentation and consumption of information. The age of the internet has made information more accessible than at any other time in human history and the presentation and dissemination of that information is what drives most technology today. In my work, I continually strive to share my passion for technology with others and give users the tools necessary to accomplish tasks from the menial to the extraordinary. I get no greater joy in my work than seeing someone else have that "eureka!" moment when they realize the possibilities of whatever tool, website, or piece of software they may be using.
